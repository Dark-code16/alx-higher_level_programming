# SQL - Introduction

This initial SQL project, undertaken at Alx School, marked my introduction to SQL and relational databases. The project focused primarily on tasks related to data definition, data manipulation language, the creation of subqueries, and the application of functions.

## Usage :dolphin:

* Scripts [3-list_tables.sql](./3-list_tables.sql) forward take the database to query
from as a MySQL command line argument.

```
$ cat 3-list_tables.sql | mysql -h localhost -u root -p mysql
```

* Tasks 101-103 query from the database [temperatures.sql](./temperatures.sql)
